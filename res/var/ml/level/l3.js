Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
<br><br>
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
<br><br>
A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.
<br><br>
Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:
${FullCode(`speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]`)}
The standard deviation is: ${WordCode('0.9')}
<br><br>
Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value, which is 86.4.
<br><br>
Let us do the same with a selection of numbers with a wider range:
${FullCode(`speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]`)}
The standard deviation is: ${WordCode('37.85')}
<br><br>
Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 37.85 from the mean value, which is 77.4.
<br><br>
As you can see, a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
<br><br>
The NumPy module has a method to calculate the standard deviation:
${FullCode(`
import numpy
speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]
x = numpy.std(speed)
print(x)`, `Use the NumPy ${WordCode('std()')} method to find the standard deviation:`)}
${OutputCode('0.9035079029052513')}

Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.
<br><br>
In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation!
<br><br>
Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance!
<br><br>
To calculate the variance you have to do as follows:
1. Find the mean:
${FullCode(`(32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4`)}
2. For each value: find the difference from the mean:
${FullCode(`
32 - 77.4 = -45.4
111 - 77.4 =  33.6
138 - 77.4 =  60.6
 28 - 77.4 = -49.4
 59 - 77.4 = -18.4
 77 - 77.4 = - 0.4
 97 - 77.4 =  19.6`)}
3. For each difference: find the square value:
${FullCode(`
(-45.4)2 = 2061.16
 (33.6)2 = 1128.96
 (60.6)2 = 3672.36
(-49.4)2 = 2440.36
(-18.4)2 =  338.56
(- 0.4)2 =    0.16
 (19.6)2 =  384.16`)}
4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences:
${FullCode(`(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) / 7 = 1432.2`)}
Luckily, NumPy has a method to calculate the variance:
${FullCode(`
import numpy
speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]
x = numpy.var(speed)
print(x)`, `Use the NumPy ${WordCode('var()')} method to find the variance:`)}
${OutputCode('1432.2448979591834')}
`; //message

k++;
window["type"+k] = "message";
window["ti"+k] = "Standard Deviation"; //title
window["msg"+k] = `
As we have learned, the formula to find the standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
${FullCode(`√1432.25 = 37.85`)}
Or, as in the example from before, use the NumPy to calculate the standard deviation:
${FullCode(`
import numpy
speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]
x = numpy.std(speed)
print(x)`)}
${OutputCode('37.84501153334721')}
