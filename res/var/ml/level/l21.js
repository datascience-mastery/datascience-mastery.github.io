Logistic Regression is another statistical analysis method borrowed by Machine Learning. It is used when our dependent variable is dichotomous or binary. It just means a variable that has only 2 outputs, for example, A person will survive this accident or not, The student will pass this exam or not. The outcome can either be yes or no (2 outputs). This regression technique is similar to linear regression and can be used to predict the <b>Probabilities</b> for classification problems.

<p><strong>Here are the three main types of logistic regression</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Binary logistic regression</strong></p>
<p>Binary logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, such as yes or no, true or false, or 0 or 1. For example, it could be used to predict whether a customer will churn or not, whether a patient has a disease or not, or whether a loan will be repaid or not<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multinomial logistic regression</strong></p>
<p>Multinomial logistic regression is used to predict the probability of one of three or more possible outcomes, such as the type of product a customer will buy, the rating a customer will give a product, or the political party a person will vote for.</p>
<p><strong>Ordinal logistic regression</strong></p>
<p><strong>i</strong>s used to predict the probability of an outcome that falls into a predetermined order, such as the level of customer satisfaction, the severity of a disease, or the stage of cancer.</p>

window["msg"+k] = `
<p>After reading the definition of logistic regression we now know that it is only used when our dependent variable is binary and in linear regression this dependent variable is continuous.</p>
<p>The second problem is that if we add an outlier in our dataset, the best fit line in linear regression shifts to fit that point.</p>
<p>Now, if we use linear regression to find the best fit line which aims at minimizing the distance between the predicted value and actual value, the line will be like this:</p>
${ShowImage('60.png')}
<p>Here the threshold value is 0.5, which means if the value of h(x) is greater than 0.5 then we predict malignant tumor (1) and if it is less than 0.5 then we predict benign tumor (0). Everything seems okay here but now let’s change it a bit, we add some outliers in our dataset, now this best fit line will shift to that point. Hence the line will be somewhat like this:</p>
${ShowImage('61.png')}
<p>Do you see any problem here? The blue line represents the old threshold and the yellow line represents the new threshold which is maybe 0.2 here. To keep our predictions right we had to lower our threshold value. Hence we can say that linear regression is prone to outliers. Now here if h(x) is greater than 0.2 then only this regression will give correct outputs.</p>
<p>Another problem with linear regression is that the predicted values may be out of range. We know that probability can be between 0 and 1, but if we use linear regression this probability may exceed 1 or go below 0.</p>
<p>To overcome these problems we use Logistic Regression, which converts this straight best fit line in linear regression to an S-curve using the sigmoid function, which will always give values between 0 and 1. How does this work and what’s the math behind this will be covered in a later section?</p>

window["msg"+k] = `
<p>Log loss, also known as logarithmic loss or cross-entropy loss, is a common evaluation metric for binary classification models. It measures the performance of a model by quantifying the difference between predicted probabilities and actual values. Log-loss is indicative of how close the prediction probability is to the corresponding actual/true value (0 or 1 in case of binary classification), penalizing inaccurate predictions with higher values. Lower log-loss indicates better model performance.</p>
<p>Log Loss is the most important classification metric based on probabilities. It’s hard to interpret raw log-loss values, but log-loss is still a good metric for comparing models. For any given problem, a lower log loss value means better predictions.</p>
<p><i>Mathematical interpretation:</i></p>
<p>Log Loss is the negative average of the log of corrected predicted probabilities for each instance.</p>
<p><i>Let us understand it with an example:</i></p>
${ShowImage('68.png')}
<p>The model is giving predicted probabilities as shown above.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-corrected-probabilities"><b>What are the corrected probabilities?</b></h3>
<p>-&gt; By default, the output of the logistics regression model is the probability of the sample being positive(indicated by 1) i.e if a logistic regression model is trained to classify on a <b>company&nbsp; dataset</b> then the predicted probability column says What is the probability that the person has bought jacket. Here in the above data set the probability that a person with ID6 will buy a jacket is 0.94.</p>
<p>In the same way, the probability that a person with ID5 will buy a jacket (i.e. belong to class 1) is 0.1 but the actual class for ID5 is 0, so the probability for the class is (1-0.1)=0.9. 0.9 is the correct probability for ID5.</p>
${ShowImage('69.png')}
<p><b>We will find a log of corrected probabilities for each instance</b>.</p>
${ShowImage('70.png')}
<p>As you can see these log values are negative. To deal with the negative sign, we take the<b> negative average of these values</b>, to maintain a common convention that lower loss scores are better.</p>
${ShowImage('71.png')}
<p><b> In short, there are three steps to find Log Loss:</b></p>

</ol>
<p><b><i>If we summarize all the above steps, we can use the formula:-</i></b></p>
${ShowImage('72.png')}
<p>Here Yi represents the actual class and log(p(yi)is the probability of that class.</p>
<ul>
<li> <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;">p(yi) is the probability of 1.</span> </li>
<li> <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;">1-p(yi) is the probability of 0.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Now Let’s see how the above formula is working in two cases:</b></p>
<ol>
<li> <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;">When the actual class is 1: second term in the formula would be 0 and we will left with first term i.e. yi.log(p(yi)) and (1-1).log(1-p(yi) this will be 0.</span> </li>
<li> <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;">When the actual class is 0: First-term would be 0 and will be left with the second term i.e (1-yi).log(1-p(yi)) and 0.log(p(yi)) will be 0.</span> </li>
</ol>
<p><i>wow!! we got back to the original formula for binary cross-entropy/log loss 🙂</i></p>

<b>Q1. Why do we use log loss?</b><br>
<p>A. Log loss is commonly used as an evaluation metric for binary classification tasks for several reasons. Firstly, it provides a continuous and differentiable measure of the model’s performance, making it suitable for optimization algorithms. Secondly, log loss penalizes confident and incorrect predictions more heavily, incentivizing calibrated probability estimates. Finally, log loss can be interpreted as the logarithmic measure of the likelihood of the predicted probabilities aligning with the true labels.</p>
<br><br><b>Q2. What is a good log loss?</b><br>
<p>A. The interpretation of a “good” log loss value depends on the specific context and problem domain. In general, a lower log loss indicates better model performance. However, what constitutes a good log loss can vary depending on the complexity of the problem, the availability of data, and the desired level of accuracy. It is often useful to compare the log loss of different models or benchmarks to assess their relative performance.</p>
