A ${WordCode('for')} loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
<br><br>
This is less like the ${WordCode('for')} keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
<br><br>
With the ${WordCode('for')} loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
${FullCode(`
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the ${WordCode('range()')} function,
<br><br>
The ${WordCode('range()')} function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

${Note(`${WordCode('range(6)')} is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.`)}
The ${WordCode('range()')} function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: ${WordCode('range(2, 6)')},
which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
${FullCode(`
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)`, 'Using the start parameter:')}
${OutputCode(`
2
3
4
5`)}
The ${WordCode('range()')} function defaults to increment the sequence by 1,
however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: ${WordCode('range(2, 30, 3)')}:
${FullCode(`
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)`, 'Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):')}

The ${WordCode('else')} keyword in a ${WordCode('for')} loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
