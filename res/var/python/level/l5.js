Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

${WordCode(`'hello'`)} is the same as ${WordCode(`"hello"`)}.

You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
<h3>Example:</h3>
${FullCode(`
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
`)}
Or three single quotes:
${FullCode(`
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
<br><br>
However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
<br><br>
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
<br>
${FullCode(`
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
print(a[0])`)}
The above code will print 1st index of variable 'a'.
${OutputCode(`
e
H`)}
${Note('Index starts from zero.')}

window["msg"+k] = `
To get the length of a string, use the ${WordCode('len()')} function.
${FullCode(`
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
`)}
The ${WordCode('len()')} function returns the length of a string:
${OutputCode('13')}
${Note(`space are also counted in ${WordCode('len()')} function`)}

You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
<br><br>
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
${FullCode(`
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])`)}
Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included)
${OutputCode('llo')}

By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])`)}
Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included)
${OutputCode(`Hello`)}

`; //message

window["ti"+k] = "Slice To the End"; //title

By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])`)}
Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end
${OutputCode(`llo, World!`)}

window["msg"+k] = `
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:

print(b[-5:-2])`)}
Get the characters:
<br><br>
From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)

<h3>Upper Case</h3>
The ${WordCode('upper()')} method returns the string in upper case:
${FullCode(`
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper()`)}
${OutputCode(`
HELLO, WORLD!`)}
<h3>Lower Case</h3>
The ${WordCode('lower()')} method returns the string in lower case:
${FullCode(`
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())`)}
${OutputCode('hello, world!')}
<h3>Remove Whitespace</h3>
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
${FullCode(`
a = " Hello, World! "
#Notice the space at beginning and end of the string
print(a.strip())`)}
${OutputCode(`Hello, World!`)}
`; //message

window["ti"+k] = "String Format"; //title
window["msg"+k] = `
We can combine strings and numbers by using the ${WordCode('format()')} method
<br><br>
The ${WordCode('format()')} method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders ${WordCode('{}')} are:
${FullCode(`
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))`)}
${OutputCode(`My name is John, and I am 36`)}
The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
${FullCode(`
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))`)}
${OutputCode(`I want 3 pieces of item 567 for 49.95 dollars.`)}
You can use index numbers ${WordCode('{0}')} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:
${FullCode(`
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))`)}
${OutputCode(`I want to pay 49.95 dollars for 3 pieces of item 567`)}

window["msg"+k] = `
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
<br><br>
An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
<br><br>
An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
<br>
${FullCode(`txt = "You "are" awesome."`)}
${OutputCode(`SyntaxError: invalid syntax`, true)}
To fix this problem, use the escape character \":
${FullCode(`txt = "You \\"are"\\ awesome."`)}
${OutputCode(`You "are" awesome.`)}
